## Research
**Automated Essay Evaluation Systems**: Under the supervision of Prof. King, I am developing an automated essay evaluation system with the [KEEP](https://keep.edu.hk/). This system aims to assist teachers in grading essays and improve users' English writing skills. It will be showcased at the EXPO in early December to gather feedback for further optimization before being released to the public.

**Adversarial Attacks on Facial Recognition API**: Thanks to the guidance of Prof. Ho, I began exploring deep learning with a focus on adversarial attacks on facial recognition APIs. I applied various methods, including black-box and white-box attacks, to facial recognition systems and analyzed the outcomes to identify their weaknesses and biases.

## Project

For better user experience, CubeCU implemented tag choice, visibility setting and recommendation system. Besides, admin user has an additional panel to manage user permissions, content moderation, and system monitoring.
**Computer Sales Database System**: A computer sales database system developed using MySQL and Java, starting with ER diagram design and optimized for performance through Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and the Grace Hash Join technique.

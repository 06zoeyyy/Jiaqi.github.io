## Passion
The journey from Northwest China to Hong Kong allowed me to witness firsthand the impact of educational resource disparities on individuals.

In my experience organizing and participating in volunteer teaching, the most memorable was in [Da Chuan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dachuancun,+%E6%B5%B7%E5%8E%9F%E7%B8%A3%E4%B8%AD%E8%A1%9B%E5%B8%82%E5%AF%A7%E5%A4%8F%E5%9B%9E%E6%97%8F%E8%87%AA%E6%B2%BB%E5%8D%80%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B755200/@36.5499614,105.7252393,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x364320534977b6d5:0x9f09907500bdfc22!8m2!3d36.549962!4d105.735539!16s%2Fg%2F11c61kskdn?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)â€”a remote, mountainous village. There, I realized that merely improving facilities cannot change the reality of poor education, as no one knew how to use these advanced equipments.

This led me to explore AI and software development, with the aim of integrating AI tools into educational software to lower learning barriers.

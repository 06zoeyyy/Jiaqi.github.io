## Passion
The journey from Northwest China to Hong Kong allowed me to witness firsthand the impact of educational resource disparities on individuals.

In my experience organizing and participating in volunteer teaching, the most memorable was in Da Chuanâ€”a remote, mountainous village. There, I realized that merely improving hardware facilities cannot change the reality of poor education, as no one knew how to use these advanced equipments.

This led me to explore AI and software development, with the aim of integrating AI into educational software to lower learning barriers.
## Beyond Academic
* I enjoy discovering myself and the world while traveling.
* I am always looking forward to talk with people from different backgrounds and make friends.
* I love the sun and the sea, as well as the snow.
* When doing sports-swiming, basketball and so on, I focus more on myself.

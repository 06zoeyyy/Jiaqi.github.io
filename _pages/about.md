## About me
Hi:)I'm Jiaqi GAO (È´ò‰Ω≥Áê™), a final year undergraduate majoring in computer science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/) for my Final Year Project. Prior to this, I was also honored to be advised by [Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho](https://tsungyiho.github.io/).

My research experience covers various aspects of deep learning and software development. Under the supervision of Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho, I focused on adversarial attack in computer vision. For my most recent research with Prof. Irwin King, I expanded my work to include educational software development and large language models. I'm still going to explore more aspects to enrich myself.

## About me
Hi! I’m Jiaqi (Joey) Gao (高佳琪). I am a Master of Science in Applied Computing ([MScAc](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) student at the University of Toronto, starting in September 2025.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html. My research and professional work focus on the intersection of Machine Learning, LLM Application Engineering, and Data Engineering. I am passionate about building robust, AI-enabled systems to solve complex real-world challenges.

## About me
Hi:) I'm Jiaqi GAO (高佳琪), a fourth year undergraduate majoring in computer science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). Currently, I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/) for my Final Year Project at CUHK. Prior to this, I was also honored to be advised by [Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho](https://tsungyiho.github.io/) at CUHK.

My research experience covers various aspects of deep learning and software development. Under the supervision of Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho, I focused on adversarial attack in computer vision. For my most recent research with Prof. Irwin King, I expanded my work to include educational software development and large language models. I'm still going to explore more aspects to enrich myself.

## Academic Experience
**Automated Essay Evaluation Systems**

Under the supervision of Prof. King, I am developing an automated essay evaluation system with the [KEEP](https://keep.edu.hk/). This system aims to assist teachers in grading essays and improve users' English writing skills. It will be showcased at the EXPO in early December to gather feedback for further optimization before being released to the public.
